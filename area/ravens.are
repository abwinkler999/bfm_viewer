albergather bookseller old wizard~
Albergather~
Albergather the bookseller wanders around, filing dusty manuscripts.
~
Albergather is an old wizard who has eschewed the actual practice of
magic for the rarified pleasures of reading about it.  His bookshop is one
of the greatest repositories of rare texts in all Balfeymere, although the
majority of them are of very narrow interest.

Panning is a jolly, cheerful sort of fellow.  His clothes are perpetually
covered in a layer of flour, but his demeanour is tidy and professional.  He
somehow manages to keep an eye on all his employees while still tending to

Ruddygear himself stands at the counter, inspecting goods.
~
Ruddygear is a surprisingly unadventurous-looking man of about forty.  He
seems to enjoy talking with his patrons and selling his adventuring goods,
although his stories of his own exploits seem a trifle outlandish, and you
begin to wonder if he's ever even seen the wilderness in his life.

Koghim~
Koghim the Weaponsmith yanks a sword out of a block of wood.
~
They say Koghim is actually an ogre, not the Thalosian he claims to be. 
Certainly his stature belies his nonhuman roots, and renders almost everyone
unwilling to ask personal questions.  Ogre or otherwise, Koghim suffers very
little from theft even here in the Feverward; with his colossal strength he
finds it very simple to leave the floor samples imbedded into wooden blocks
when he's not using them!

Oiotim is a gruff dwarf well into middle age.  Having once been forbidden
from practicing his real trade, weaponsmithing, within the City, he turned

coarse white.  These days, Erastus has turned over most of the
administration of the Academy to underlings, and spends his time sitting
beneath the olive tree in the courtyard, whittling small charms and offering
very subtle advice to students.  Many avoid him for his unhelpful tutelage;
wiser pupils flock to him for his quiet insights.

Colonel Hanno~
Colonel Hanno paces up and down the room, inspecting the trainees.
~
Colonel Hanno wears the uniform of a city watchman, apparently the only
one he has ever possessed, judging by the tears, patches, and burn markings
of three dozen campaigns.  Hanno is a grim man of late middle age, a relic
of a bygone age when Ravenspur fielded a regular military force and mounted
campaigns in adjacent lands.  These days, the City's martial endeavours are
relegated to patrolling Ravenspur itself, but Hanno has stayed on to each
each successive crop of recruits the rudiments of fighting and offer
instruction to warriors passing through town.  The commander of the City
Watch in these times ranks a Captain, so Hanno is technically of paramount
rank (and certainly seniority), but he is content in semi-retirement.

keep a sword or pike in their home.  The citizens of Ravenspur live mostly

large whiskers and noses.  These creatures are mostly harmless, but should
not be provoked.  They are reputed to eat practically anything.

The famous Archibald Maston stands before you.  Famous in his prime for his

as if the light were always slightly too bright.  It is said that he has
never yet lost his taste for new trophies, even if he must send the "younger

here most afternoons of the week, to hang around Yenna, although he doesn't
seem to have much luck getting her to notice him.

soldier ravenspur bridgemark guards~
the Ravenspur soldier~
A soldier of the Bridgemark Guards is here.
~
The City Legion of Ravenspur attracts the toughest fighting men from the
area who do not choose to become mercenaries.  These men make no pretensions
about their job; their responsibility is to kill the enemies of the City and
to protect its prestige and influence.  Unsurprisingly, this has given them
a rather harsh reputation amongst Ravenspur's neighbors.  
 
This soldier is attached to the Bridgemark Guards, one of the City's
regular regiments.

A Southman mills about aimlessly.

The Southmen are the refugees who were driven out of Knathelos during the
civil war several years ago.  They have been encamped across the river from
Ravenspur ever since, but few have found gainful employment.  The rest pass
their time in the stews and half-ruined camps of what is now called
Southmanstown.

Cassandra~
A severe-looking woman dressed in purple inventories a box of jars.
~
Cassandra was an adventuring wizardess who retired to open a business
selling spell components and magical objects.  She bought an old butcher
shop from a man named Rorbrin, on the understanding that she'd be staying in
the same line of business; the contract stipulated that the place keep its
current name.  Cleverly, she opened a shop of curiosities called "Rorbrin's
Butcher Shop".  The old butcher had the last laugh, however; she has never
been able to get the smell out of the place.  Unwilling to give up the
location, she resorts to hanging up dozens of tapestries to mask the scent
from the walls.

It is not clear whether the slightly silly angle at which the statue has
settled in the mud was the intention of whoever placed it here.

Blackmantle Lane, Ravenspur~
This shabby little street runs north and south through a sparsely
populated quarter of Ravenspur.  The houses here seem old and almost
sagging; the street itself seems in poor repair and a general air of
apathetic squalor hangs heavily over this district.  There seem to be very
few children playing in the streets, and even travellers seem rather
infrequent.  Although this end of town is fairly poor, there doesn't seem to
be much crime; perhaps the prevailing atmosphere of hopelessness does not
inspire miscreants to linger long.  Blackmantle Lane continues north and
intersects with Whitemantle to the south.  
 
A small, dilapidated-looking shop to the west advertises 'Haberdasher' from
a discreet sign.

Two features are of interest:  a large funeral parlor stands to the east,
while a freestanding dolmen of granite resides in the middle of the street
close at hand.

dolmen~
This dolmen is a solid oblong of granite, obviously weathered by the
relentless forces of long exposure to the elements.  Carved into the
south-facing side of the boulder is a curious relief: the face of a large
bird, probably a raven, eyes and beak plainly visible in the ancient
petroglyph.  You can barely make out some strange letters carved into the
rock around the face; they are too eroded to be legible.

Carrick Street, Ravenspur~
Carrick Street is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Ravenspur; nestled
in one of the highest points of the hill, it consists mainly of old mansions
now passed out of fashion or into obscurity.  Some of these have been
converted into apartments for artisans or adventurous nobles; one or two
forms the headquarters for some society or other.  Trees line the street,
and ivy many of the houses.  Carrick Street here runs north and south.  The
western side of the street is entirely occupied by a tall hedge, surrounding
some sort of gardens.

Carrick Street, Ravenspur~
This stretch of Carrick Street forms the border between the Feverward and
more upscale parts of Ravenspur.  The old mansions which dot either side of
the street are largely divided up into small apartments for up-and-coming
mercenaries and prosperous mages; a few even stand empty.  To the north the
shady precincts of Carrick Street runs alongside the public gardens.  To the
south the mansions grow shabbier, replaced largely with apartment buildings
and small shops.  To the west Ague Alley leads between rows of rickety old
tenements.

Carrick Street, Ravenspur~
The colorful spectacle of Carrick Street in the Feverward makes it one of
the busiest parts of town.  Decrepit old mansions have been renovated,
expanded, and renovated again until little is distinguishable of the
original architecture.  Towering apartment buildings are painted in a
dazzling array of colors and styles; nearly every building here has a
balcony and nearly every balcony is packed with musicians practicing their
arts or solitary figures sipping wine and reading.  Street pipers mingle
with shady peddlers and artists hawking their works on sidewalk stands. 
Innumerable small shops are crowded into old basement studios.  Carrick
Street here is narrow and a little dark, owing to the height of the
surrounding buildings, but the residents seem cheerful or at least
oblivious.  The street continues north and south.  
 
A brightly-painted sign advertises a bakery on the east side of the street.
 
A half-timbered building to the west displays a sign bearing the emblem of
a large wedge of cheese.

Southquarter Bridge~
The Southquarter Bridge is a huge, squat construction of granite. 
Suspended upon massive pilings over the muddy Hocking, the Bridge was built
to handle carriage traffic between the Golden Mile through Ravenspur and the
mansions of city nobles to the south along the Hocking.  After three
successive floods a few decades ago, a Mayor of times past swore to build a
bridge which the gods themselves could not throw down - the result was the
ugly but indestructible span upon which you stand.  At the south end of the
bridge, a small fortified gatehouse houses a contingent of city guardsmen,
keeping an eye on road traffic and on the boats passing beneath your feet. 
The Southquarter Pike continues south into the countryside, and a large
plaza stands to your north within the City.

Mandover's Bridge~
Mandover's Bridge is a large, somewhat rickety old wooden bridge which
passes over the Hocking River in the midst of Ravenspur's waterfront
district.  It was built extravagantly of rare ochre teakwood by one Mandover
Hadmorton, Mayor of a century or so ago.  Elegantly decorated with
hand-turned railings and allegorial carvings, the Bridge has turned a deep
chestnut and worn rather badly over the ages.  Now it somehow manages to
survive each spring flood season, largely because little traffic passes
between the docks to the north and the shantytown of Mudflat End across the
river.  Below you is the Hocking, alive with barges and small watercraft. 
Ravenspur lies north across the river, and a dirt road begins to the south.

Saltmaker Way, Ravenspur~
Saltmaker Way is a long, winding road which runs parallel to the
Greywater along most of its length.  It is bordered on one side by the murky
river, and on the other by a motley collection of small shops, musty old
cafes, ramshackle apartment houses, and odds and ends of old statuary.  One
building in particular is of interest: a run-down old tenement stands by
itself on the eastern side of the street, its exterior entirely covered by
thick grey-green strands of ivy.  The Ivies, as it's usually called, has
stood abandoned for more than sixty years.  The Way continues north and
south along this stretch of the Greywater.

east.  Against the western side of the Way stands a rotten old pier, sagging
gently into the river.  Macklin's Landing, as it has long been called, is
home to a number of small watercraft, perilously lashed to one or another of
the rotting pilings.  A muddy dirt track leads up from the pier to the Way
itself.  The street leads east and north.

Saltmaker Way, Ravenspur~
Saltmaker Way wanders through the heart of the Feverward here, a
cheerfully crumbling district of old buildings abandoned during the Plague
of thirty years back.  Since then, the Ward has been largely occupied by
adventurers, dwelling in the inns and rooming-houses here and making
occasional sallys into the depths of the Salt Marshes or the upper reaches
of the Greywater.  The streets seem full of persons clad in armor, and
everyone goes armed.  The Way continues north and south.  
 
An impressive-looking (and quite large) sign declares that a sizeable shop
to the east is "RUDDYGEAR'S OUTFITTING COMPANY".

pot-shots at someone's laundry line with spells or arrows.  
The Way continues west and south, and Carrick Street begins to the east.
A stout-looking shop occupies the ground floor of a building to the north;
an iron breastplate swings gently from two hooks before it.

occasional sallys into the depths of the Salt Marshes or the upper reaches

treasure maps on the corners, or hawk their bodyguard services in loud
voices.  Everybody else seems to be busy planning their next expedition, or
recovering from the last one.  
The Way continues east, and ends at the Saltgate to the west.  A dark,
narrow alley twists crookedly northwards.
A large stone shop occupies the ground floor of an old tavern to the south.
In lieu of a sign, it seems to have what looks like a battleaxe plunged
clean through a tree stump.

Ague Alley~
Ague Alley is a dark, narrow, shabby sort of place, with a brutal charm
all its own amidst the sundry stews of the Feverward.  The wretched gambling
dens, dirty taverns, and dubious brothels which populate the cellars and
first-floor salons of this alley are well-frequented by every sort of
wandering mercenary, sellsword, and down-on-their-luck adventuring brigand. 
Duels in the streets are as common as impromptu duets between groups of
drunken warriors slipping into unconsciousness.  The cobblestones are
greasy, the buildings are dingy, and the neighborhood is well beloved by the
adventurers who call Ravenspur home.  The Alley continues west, and joins
Carrick Street to the east.  
 
A rather small and unimpressive grate is set into the ground. Stale water, 
clogged with debris and other flotsam, trickles down it.

signboard, and a prevailing yellow smoke seems to bubble out from beneath
the front door.

Taproom at the "Bucket of Lye"~
You are greeted by the ungodly odor of alcohol, scorching food, and
various other unpleasantries.  The 'Bucket' is often described as the bottom
of the cesspool; this run-down dive on Ague Alley certainly looks the part. 
Several tables, some overturned, are covered with rubbish, broken mugs, and
bowls of what might be referred to kindly as food.  A few mean-looking
wenches wander around; their clothes at least are in good condition, having
apparently spent more time on the floor than on them.  In short, this bar is
filled with the scum of the city.  A broken saloon door leads out to the
east.

This is a jolly, friendly, bustling sort of place, filled with the warm
aroma of baking bread.  The walls are covered in shelves upon which cool
loaves of bread, pretzel-like twists, pies, tarts, and all other sorts of
baked goods.  Cleverly designed skylights admit the morning sunlight,
permitting Panning's to bathe in a warm, cheery glow.  A long, broad counter
holds an enticing array of pastries and cakes, while a large crew of bakers
tend rows of cast-iron ovens in the back.  The bakery is clean and tidy,
although everything seems to be covered in a very light dusting of flour.  A
door leads out to Carrick Street.  
 
A back staircase appears to lead up into a private apartment.

Hylmaker's Weapons~
The weaponry displayed in this shop is sufficient to act out even the
most expensive fantasies of martial aggression.  Axes, daggers, halberds,
and swords all hang upon the walls or from the ceiling in a gleaming,
shining dance of polished, razor-sharp steel.  As you look closer, however,
you can see that each weapon is tied securely into its scabbard or sports a
leather blade-guard, keeping passersby safe from accidental decapitation. 
This shop smells strongly of oil and whetstone dust, and you can hear the
occasional sound of hammer upon steel, perhaps coming from the back room. 
To the west, a door reinforced with steel bands leads back out to Hocking
Street.

This store is brightly lit with a combination of skylights and magical
flameless lanterns, apparently due to the perponderance of flammables.  The
stationer's shop is full of scribes squinting at each sheet of vellum or
papyrus, examining each in painstaking detail for flaws.  The walls are
covered with cubbyholes, full of long rolls of parchment or bottles of ink. 
A few academics mill about, murmuring obscure philosophical arguments at
each other in barely audible tones.  The air is full of paper dust, and the
floor full of scraps of parchment.  A door leads back out to Whitemantle

shopfront windows which also look out what appears to have once been a large

the countryside along the Hocking River.  It is well-maintained to the point
of being manicured; trees are pruned rather than hacked out of the way, and
in low spots you can even see what look like stone drains to prevent
flooding during rainstorms.  The Pike runs through a region of open fields
of grass and wildflowers.  To the north you can see a large, well-guarded
stone bridge and beyond that the City of Ravenspur.  To the south the Pike

The village of Byhampton is a cozy little hamlet tucked away on the
eastern bank of the Hocking River.  Byhampton seems impossibly tidy; unlike
the majority of similar towns, every building is freshly-painted and the
townsfolk seem uniformly prosperous.  The majority of buildings in Byhampton
seem to be rooming-houses or country taverns, and there are an unusually
large number of well-dressed ladies and gentlemen lounging about.  It seems
that Byhampton is a largely artificial retreat for world-weary
sophisticates, who come to the country to escape the pressures of city life,
only to bring with them the things they sought to flee.  The villagers, such
as they are, make a fine living selling ale and trinkets to gullible city
folk.  The Southquarter Pike leads north out of town, while the Scores trail
off to the east.

pinched-faced washerwomen earn a living boiling huge tubs of laundry in
front of their homes, while wan children chase one another and hunt rats. 
Here on the south side of the Hocking, it seems, hope is far away.  A few

The End continues west, and a new street, recently cleared from the mud and

upon these chains are a wide variety of padlocks; thick iron padlocks bundle
lengths of chain together, while tiny silver heart-lockets hang daintly upon
single links.  A broad counter rests across the back of the room, and a
workbench beyond where the locksmith works at his craft.  A door leads back
out to the west.

Peter's Rooming House~
A wide entrance hall, which by all appearances once swept grandly into
the ballroom, sitting room, and study stops abruptly at a series of
partition walls in which are set stout and very recently erected doors. 
Each door has a small placard-inset for a name, and a strong lock and
door-knocker.  The floor is convered in an ornate, if rather faded, mosaic
of a pastoral scene.  An elegantly framed front door leads back out to
Carrick Street to the west.  
 
A narrow wooden staircase leads up to a second floor landing.

Cityguard Head Quarters~
You stand inside a tidy office, filled with guardsmen receiving patrol
assignments, filing reports, and detaining prisoners.  The room is greatly
congested with desks of various sizes, although a rack of weaponry stands at
the ready against one wall.  One particularly large desk stands inside a
partition at one end of the room.  On the south wall of the Headquarters is
a section of what looks like freshly laid brick, painted over with the arms
of the City.  A very sturdy door leads back out to the Golden Mile.

Whiterose Street, Southmanstown~
A wide, muddy street is emerging from the haphazard tent city of crude
pavilions and cooking fires.  Small huts of scrap wood and mud line the
street, which passes north towards Ravenspur and south towards a castle on
the edge of the wilderness.  The largest of the few permanent structures
around is a wooden building standing along the eastern side of the road; the
emblem of a rose has been whitewashed onto its stout door.  An impromptu
farmers' market has emerged in the wide square outside this church, and even
in the winter carts and wagons can be seen, with men nearby selling
provisions.  The street continues south and joins Mudflat End to the north. 
 
The abandoned warehouse of the Hammerbeam Storage Company is along the
western side of the street.

House of the White Rose~
This simple, spartan building appears to have been hastily constructed. 
A simple building of boards and plaster about forty feet square, it contains
a few rows of benches, a small kitchen, and an altar, bedecked with circlets
of grass entwined with roses.  A few monks in grey robes move here and there
through the throng of ragged refugees who crowd the room, treating illness
and distributing food.  A stout wooden door, banded with strips of bronze,
leads out to the west.

You are in a cluttered flat.  The walls are lined with bizarre trophies
of expeditions to distant parts: various specimens of taxidermy from the
shaggy to the scaled intermingle with tattered banners, bits of weaponry,
and the occasional dented shield.  A desk sits at the western end of the
room, partially covered by a heavy carpet, and entirely covered with papers
and weatherbeaten books.  No bed is evident, although moth-eaten couches
abound.  A staircase from which wafts odors of baking bread leads down.

A large shadowy space is formed by the mass of Dagnar's Folly overhead. 
This artificial pit, surrounded in four sides by the walls of other
buildings, is littered with the fallen flotsam of decades - dropped change,
scraps of paper, and broken pottery.  Above you is a large wooden platform,
about twenty feet over your head, with a long staircase ascending to it.  A

set so tightly in its frame as to be almost invisible; farther down the

significant change in temperature.  At the bottom, the staircase is blocked
by an ancient, rusted sheet of metal, thickly covered with grime and years
of mold around its edges.

Entryway, Order of the Blue Horse~
You find yourself in a large room which serves as an entryway into this
building.  The floor is wood polished wood of a deep brown hue.  The walls
are smooth and flat, painted a very light, soft shade of blue.  Various art
adorns the walls, depicting images of man in the backdrop of nature.  One
particular painting grabs your attention, a man sitting on a stool dressed
in formal clothing against a black background.  A large tapestry hangs from
the eastern wall, a wooden desk in front of it.  There is a small staircase
leading to the second floor, while an open doorway, the word 'Training Hall'
carved in stone above it, leads north.  The southern wall houses a rather
non-descript door, a small note tacked onto it, while the exit west leads

Training Room, Order of the Blue Horse~
The hard wood floor in this room has been covered with various mats and
pads.  The room serves as a training room of sorts, where members of the
guild come to hone their battle skills as well as their curative abilities. 
You see several men sparring with one another with weapons while another
group of men occupies themselves with boxing.  On the other side of the room
you see an older man instructing a group of young men in the art of
navigation and compass usage.  A large map adorns the north wall, small
circles in red ink dotting various parts of the map.  Several men can be
seen adding new circles while chatting enthusiastically.  The exit to the

The room is adorned with several maps, entirely foreign to you.  One
seems to depict a range of large mountains, the words "Maston's Peak"
written on the bottom.  Another is of a region known as the "Emerald
Forest."  The eastern wall is home to a large painting of a series of
cascading waterfalls, the blues and whites meshing together to create a
three dimensional illusion.  A small desk sits in front of the painting, a
few stray sheets of parchment and quill pen on its top.  One sheet of
parchment in particular catches your eye, a flowing script filling its
space.  Two bookshelves line the northern wall on both sides of the doorway

Fredericks,
 
We have finally opened a chapter here in Ravenspur after much effort.
We discovered that several prominent individuals here in the city
have long been members of our cause, and thus were able to secure
financing for our building.  It seems now, more than ever, with war
on the brink of explosion between these two city-states that our work
is of a most urgent nature.  It pains me to think that we will continue
to be misunderstood by many of those whom we protect, but such is our
duty, such is the cross we must bear.  I hope all is well with you,
and that your work on the eastern outpost if fulfilling and fruitful.
Anytime you find yourself needing respite from the wilds, just
remember you are always welcome here, city or not.
 
Yours,
Thomas.

This room appears to be a well-upholstered bed room of sorts.  Several
beds line the walls while a series of wooden knobs from which clothing hangs
lines the northern wall.  A small fireplace made of stone sits in the
eastern wall, a warm fire glowing softly.  Many of the beds look as if they
have been slept in recently, while others seem well-made and cold.  It
appears many a guild member and traveler have spent a night beneath this
roof.

Southmans Barbican~
A small fortress sits astride the road here, forcing travellers to pass
through its great wooden portals.  The barbican is tall and elegantly
appointed, with arrow-slits cut into its crenellations and the banner of
Ravenspur waving from its turrets.  Soldiers of the City Legion are posted
beneath its portcullis, keeping an eye on the travellers which pass in and
out of the City of Ravenspur.  
 
To the south, the road passes into a dense green forest.  On the northern
side of the barbican is the outlying shantytown of Southmanstown.

The road is partially blocked by a large mass of masonry and construction

cut stone blocks and a great iron portcullis are carefully stored nearby
awaiting addition to the barbican.

Plush draperies overhang the walls, slightly mildewed with age, and dusty
mannequins sport a variety of hats from formal to fanciful.  Small mirrors
set in gilded frames are set into the walls of this shop, and an atmosphere
of torpor and sloth hangs in the air.  Some of the hatboxes piled in the

wide enough for a single person to pass.  A repeatedly-varnished wooden
bannister, worn quite smooth by age, is sunken into a groove in the brick
wall.  From somewhere below you can see light and smell candle wax.  The top
of the staircase comes to an abrupt halt at what appears to be a concealed
door carved out of the brick itself.

A long, cylindrical room made of well-mortared brick appears to have been
a water pipe at some point.  Each of the far ends is bricked off with much
newer material, and a narrow wooden spiral staircase twists upwards through
the ceiling.  The chamber is about thirty yards long.  Brass candleabras
have been installed in the walls every so often, and their candles cast a
soft but bright light in the room.  One end of the chamber is filled with
large, flat tables spread with maps and other documents; a large rack of
cubbyholes holds a number of scrolls.  A small ring of couches faces a small
table laden with decanters of various wines and liquors, and two or three
small cots are discretely concealed behind dark walnut bookcases.

A large converted meeting room~
This large room appears to have once been two separate chambers, though
lately the space has been combined as to house a rather large oval table and
a number of chairs which are scattered about the room.  A west-looking
double window affords a scenic view of the city of Ravenspur, many houses
and small businesses dotting the ground, the Basilica dominating the
skyline.  A newly-sanded and refinished hardwood floor creaks with age when
anyone walks across it, and the scent of fresh paint still lingers upon the
airs here.  The walls are whitewashed, with only a few larger drawings and
maps adorning them.  Upon the northern wall, a large banner depicting the
arms of this and various other chapters of the Blue Horse hangs centered
above an unused fireplace.  A stout and heavy wooden door leads south to the
hallway.

Large windows line the eastern and southern walls, allowing the light and
airs of the outside to stream in through off-white window laces.  A
comfortable bed rests near the southern wall, the window serving as light
overhead.  The western wall is dominated by a large tapestry, done in hues
of blue and green, depicting a scene upon the high seas.  A desk sets near
the door which lies to the north, complete with writing instruments, papers,
and a large glass oil lamp, set in a fashioned gold base.  Two large
overstuffed leather chairs sit beneath the eastern windows, a small table
setting between them.

The tapestry which hangs on the western wall is rather large- it takes up
a good portion of the upper half, hanging from a large rod, just inches from
the ceiling.  It's colored in hues of green and blue, accented with white
and silver, as waves crash below the hull of a large three-masted ship,
sails aloft, cutting through the water.  Life aboard the ship is colorful;
sailors in uniforms, officers, and even horses are present on board, as well
as what would appear to be an orchard of trees.  Various types of marine
life form a boarder for the large work- seashells, serpents, and mermaids
twist themselves around an embroidered frame of wood.

thick black timbers in an unusual arched, wicker-like pattern.  The walls
are covered in a muted tan-colored plaster, and hung with large portraits

The scent of sulphur lingers uneasily in this small room, hanging most
heavily over a large standing table which spans the southern wall.  The
table is orderly, and lined with a meager collection of glassware, ranging
from small vials, to larger rubber-stoppered beakers.  Glass tubes connect a
few of these, and literally dozens of candles and small braziers are kept at
the ready, though some are everburning, emitting an odd bluish aura.  A few
sturdy wooden cabinets line the other walls, filled with drawers and boxes
full of odds and ends of scientific apparatus.  
 
A dual set of bookcases flanks a metal-framed cot, which lines the northern
corner of the room.  Books are piled before it on the floor, awaiting space
upon the shelves; some serve as a nightstand, a lantern set upon them.
Several pegs line the back of the door; two cloaks, a couple shirts, 
sturdy aprons, and a set of robes hangs upon them.  The door otherwise leads

the cracks in the window.  The window itself has been liberally sealed with
a thick, black, tar like substance.  The ceiling above has been repeatedly
patched by the same mysterious black substance.  Several bookshelves line

full of ale.  A light weight wooden door allows passage to the west, while a

This is not a butcher shop at all, but rather a curiosity shop
specializing in magic wands, which the interior decor fails to make plain. 
The walls of this rather dim and odd-smelling store are covered in
tapestries of all sorts, from halfling tea-towels with nature scenes to
great drow war banners recounting the history of whole cities.  These
decorations are layered in some places, haphazardly overlapping as if placed
with little regard for aesthetics.  The whole back wall of this shop is
lined with dusty glass display cases, containing antiquities and magic wands
of all sorts.  Here and there, piles of papers and overturned books form
small mounds of unfinished business atop the cases, apparently put down for
a moment and forgotten.

The Old Palace~
A strangely-shaped room extends forwards from the heavy oak door in a
long oblong shape, extending thirty feet forwards and perhaps fifteen feet
wide.  The office of the Lord Mayor of Ravenspur is heavily panelled in some
kind of dark wood; the passage of years has deepened it almost to ebony. 
Ancient carvings in heavy relief depict either abstract patterns or
fragments of smaller scenes.  The Lord Mayor's desk is surprisingly small; a
rather fragile-looking wicker construction, it appears to be of elven make. 
Aside from a set of comfortable armchairs set before the large stone
fireplace, there seems to be little adornment to show that this room is the
capitol of a large and wealthy city.

Brewers Yard~
This large, open lot is surrounded on three sides by newly-constructed
brick buildings.  To the east stands a large brewery with two great
protruding chimneys; through the huge, open twin doors you can see large
copper tanks and about two dozen men working over the apparatus, hauling
sacks of grain and decanting beer into barrels.  A large stables is to the
north, where teams of horses are hitched to large delivery wagons; to the
south is a squat square warehouse, guarded by a small group of private
mercenaries.  There is much activity all over the yard, as wagons are loaded
with barrels of beer from the warehouse while others arrive with sacks of
hops and barley.  
 
Painted in large letters over the brewery entrance is the legend
'BLACKSTONES BREWING COMPANY' and the emblem of a black square.

with several dozen perfectly identical doors, each made of red-brown
mahogany and set with brightly polished brass knobs.  Each door has a small
marble name-plate affixed to it.  
 
The light in this hallway comes from large disc-shaped will-'o-the-wisps,
which bob and weave their way erratically through the misty passage.

McCator's Maps and Charts~
McCator's is almost unbelievably cluttered.  Once, it seems, this store
featured several rows of bookshelves and display tables; now all most
resemble burial mounds submerged beneath an ancient layer of maps, scrolls,
nautical charts, rough sketches on sheets of vellum, incomplete
cartographical experiments drying atop whatever's handy, pots of colored
paint, and countless half-full inkwells.  The walls are thickly papered with
layer upon layer of tacked-up maps, depicting every corner of the known
world and the fabulous beasts which (allegedly) inhabit those parts.  A
door, the only part of the walls not covered in charts, leads out to
Whitemantle Lane.

Vacant Loft~
This large, vacant room is crisscrossed by the building's low-angled
ceiling beams.  Bare, unvarnished floors are stacked with years of leftover
junk - empty brandy casks, small heaps of straw, dusty crates full of clay
mugs.  The smell of sawdust and mildew hangs heavily in the stale air of the
loft.  At the eastern end of the loft is a large round window, with unusual
semicircular shutters.  A small, rickety staircase leads down into the
taproom.

This large, airy room is set with hardwood floors and three large,

windows, tied back by heavy gold tassels.  The walls are panelled in a
light, almost beige wood, with carved scrollwork in the corners, and adorned
with a few watercolors of seascapes of the far south.  A large couch,
covered in a lavender-colored cloth, and two wooden chairs are arranged
around the fireplace in the southern wall, and a round table and two more
chairs are arranged before the windows.  Against the west wall is set an
enormous wardrobe, set with brass hinges and pull-ring.  
 
A heavy door leads outside to the east, and a low archway conceals the
bedroom to the west.

vanity, set with an inlaid tabletop of a lavender-colored stone.  Resting
against the west wall is a large chest of drawers of an antique style; atop
it sits a slender lavender vase filled with fresh green polly's palms.

Entrance to the Horn and Hounds~
This is a large, open room, panelled simply in light cedar wood which
lends a very faint fresh fragrance to the air.  The room is largely empty,
save for a long row of hat and cloak pegs which extends along the western
wall.  To the north you can see the high-beamed arch of a doorway, through
which is visible the taproom of the establishment.  A stairwell winds
upwards, ending at a landing above you, although the top of the stairway is
blocked by a large, stout door.  Epping Street lies to your south through
the door.

A large mahogany bar occupies a great portion of this room, spanning the

your left, the other to your right, leading into what seems to be an
expansive kitchen area.  Shiny brass fixtures gleam brightly in the dim
light provided by hanging lanterns.  The Horn and Hounds appears to be a
tavern for travellers recently arrived from the road; the crowd in this
establishment are largely drovers, waggoners, off-duty guardsmen, and
tradesmen of the surrounding neighborhood.  The walls are decorated in
rustic memorabilia; mostly hunting trophies or polished horse brasses.  The
exit out to the cloakroom is to your south.

Shrine of Elgrathus~
The Shrine of Elgrathus in Ravenspur is a simple but elegant structure. 
Large, sharply defined marble columns support an elegant roof decorated with
allegorical characters which presumably have meaning in the faith of
Elgrathus.  The large, open shrine is quite clean and has a fresh air of
crisp parchment and book-leather about it.  Behind rows of desks sit perhaps
a dozen scribes, all transcribing books or sorting correspondence to be
relayed to distant parts.  A small, discreet altar at the southern end of
the room burns with a bright white flame, banishing shadows to the very
corners of the room.  
 
An open archway leads out to Epping Street to the north.

The Last Bottle is a ramshackle tavern, apparently constructed with a
limited eye towards permanence and aesthetics.  The walls are grey,
rough-hewn boards, unadorned except for pegs for patrons to hang their hats
and cloaks.  A low, wide bar occupies most of the room, except for a large
shelf behind upon which rest several barrels of wine and spirits.  There are
a few stools for drinking at the bar, but it is apparent that most patrons
purchase their liquor to drink elsewhere.

Grand Foyer, Fulbank Hall~
The Grand Foyer of Fulbank Hall seems to have been repeatedly renovated
over the centuries.  A pair of tall, narrow bronze-bound doors leads out
east to the Golden Mile, their backs set with great hooks for a bar.  The
foyer itself is a great halfcircle, overlooked from above by two matching
balconies from which hang enormous draperies.  The ceiling narrows into a
gilded cupola, encircled by a narrow widow's walk with a recessed staircase
leading down to one balcony.  Several doors lead off from the foyer, some
raised off the ground, with small staircases leading up to them.  Grand
stairs rise to the right and left, ascending to the two balconies.  Set into
the white marble floor are the arms of the House of Fulbank.  Elegantly
carved glass doors lead west into the ballroom.

The so-called Red Staircase rises from the entry foyer to the smaller

name because of the strange hexagonal red tiles which cover each riser,
fired with a small pointed bump in the center for better traction.
The stairs are steep, but easy to traverse despite a peculiar bend
halfway up, and intersect with a hallway to the west.

This small, square room is lined with very thick brick, probably to keep

apparatus from which a stubborn orange glow emanates, along with sweltering
heat which renders the room stuffy and oven-like.  Long iron chains, wrapped
with thick cloth, connect to what appear to be vents in the roof, which can
be opened or closed to admit fresh air.  The forge is surrounded by all
manner of long-handled iron implements: rods, hooks, small buckets, and
other such accoutrements of the blacksmith's trade.  Most of the rest of the
room is occupied by a great anvil, and several heat- withered wooden
workbenches, on which various blades are being completed.

Salt Gate, Ravenspur~
The Saltgate seems perpetually shrouded in fog, the damp-looking tail end
of the Ravenspur city wall which separates the City from the soggy,
trackless marshes to the west.  The district around the Saltgate was famous
for plague about thirty years ago, and a rotten sign still forbidding
travellers from entering the city through the Saltgate stil hangs listlessly
from one rusted nail.  The gate itself is constructed of grey stone, and a
rusted iron portcullis seems permanently halfway down.  The occasional party
of adventurers wanders bravely out into the gloom, while the gateguards seem
to spend a lot of their time peering out the Gate, watching for survivors
and the strange creatures which inhabit the marshes.  
Saltmaker Way leads east into the city.

Two Pennies Gate, Ravenspur~
Two Pennies Gate is a small opening let into the great city wall; not
meriting a gatehouse, it merely sports a stout oaken door and a single small
guard hut.  This gate seems to see infrequent repair; the stonework is
crumbling slowly over time and brown, dying ivy grows listlessly over the
fortifications.  Two Pennies Gate is the traditional route by which Spursmen
last leave the City; funeral parties pass this way as this gate opens out
into the Ravenspur Burying Ground, wherein repose fourteen generations of
citizens.  The moribund squalor of Blackmantle Lane lies to the south, while
the path to the Burying Ground leads out through the gate to the north.  
 
A ruined morgue abuts the city wall to the west;  its door is boarded up
and there doesn't seem to be any entrance.

Whiterose Street, Southmanstown~
This rude shantytown skirts the edge of the City of Ravenspur here. 
Whiterose Street begins here, becoming less of a muddy country trail and
more of a city street as buildings begin to cluster around it.  The street
disappears north into Southmanstown, passing down the shallow bank of the
Hocking.  Another street joins Whiterose here, extending eastwards through
land recently cleared of underbrush.  A small wooden saloon marks the edge
of Southmanstown, little more than rough boards hammered together, with a
small stables alongside.  The road quits the city completely to the south,
running towards a stone fortress which sits on the edge of the great green
mass of the Old Woods.

of buildings which forms Southmanstown.  A few lots have been staked out
along Unlucky's Street, apparently the result of careful negotiations,
judging by the rows of boundary-stones painted with various letters.  A few
people have made attempts to clear their lots, cutting away underbrush and
hauling away stones.

You stand in the midst of a large square building built of green and pale
rose-coloured marble.  The great Basilica sits in the middle of the Golden
Mile, the great avenue which runs through the middle of Ravenspur.  It is a
huge structure, cunningly designed so as to appear both open and closed at
once.  The street, restricted to pedestrians, passes freely through the open
length of the building, while small, secretive-looking chapels are enclosed
to the east and west.  Even at night, the plaza formed by the open Basilica
is bathed in a slightly eerie rose-colored light - the disquieting feeling
is no doubt intentional.  Off to one side, a spiral staircase of solid
marble blocks leads up into some sort of formal guildhall.  The Golden Mile
continues north and south, leading into a large square to the south.

The House of the Raven is dedicated to the patron gods of the city, as
embodied in the civic symbol of the Raven, who protects Ravenspur and her
citizens.  The city has, however, provided that the House of the Raven
should be open to those of foreign faiths as well, to avoid offending any
deity not already represented by his own temple.  This room is thus used for
study and contemplation by both the faithful and itinerant priests.  The
entrance to the temple is to the south, and a small room to the west is used
for personal consultations with a master of lore.

bustling with townsfolk doing business or passing the time of day and
surrounded by three- and four-story apartment buildings of elegant
appearance.  The Golden Mile runs through the square, passing through the
huge rose-marble Basilica to the north, and extending gently downhill to the
south towards the river.  Another, smaller street merges into the square to

The Golden Mile is a long boulevard which runs through the heart of the
City of Ravenspur.  In this stretch it is bounded by elegant-looking
apartment buildings of three and four stories, and the occasional nobleman's
villa.  Interspersed here and there are public buildings, well-to-do shops,
and a few small shrines.  To the north the Mile enters a large public
square, and to the south it approaches a large triumphal arch.  
 
On the eastern side of the street is a very large, bustling inn.  Its
signboard is simply a pottery face mask, painted a deep blue.

The Golden Mile is a long boulevard which runs through the heart of the
City of Ravenspur.  In this stretch it is bounded by a number of shops which
seem to cater to the higher elements in society, as well as a number of
townhouses built of brick or brownstone.  The serenity of the avenue is here
interrupted by a large stone and wooden arch, obviously built to celebrate a
victory over someone long ago; it spans the Mile in spectacular if crumbling
glory.  A large inscription is carved into the arch on its south side, and,
oddly enough, you think you can see the occasional traveller walk along the
top of the arch, dodging from one rooftop to another.  The Mile continues
north towards a distant square, and south down a gradual hill to the Hocking
River.  
 
To the east stands a very expensively appointed shop, with gilded bars covering
two of its windows.  A sign reads discreetly, "Fine Gems and Jewels".

The Golden Mile, Ravenspur~
The Golden Mile is a long boulevard which runs through the heart of the
City of Ravenspur.  Here, it surmounts a hill, running north into town, and
south to the banks of the Hocking and the grey span of the Southquarter
Bridge.  The Mile is travelled by all manner of folk, from wandering
sell-swords to noble matrons of the city.  This part of Ravenspur seems to
be rather well-to-do, with large houses lining the hillside and richly
endowed temples and mages' residences dotting the sides of the avenue here
and there.  At the top of the hill stands a large triumphal arch of some
sort, spanning the roadway.  A curious-looking house of bluish-grey stone
sits quietly upon the eastern side of the avenue.  Its architecture is
strange and archaic, and this humble dwelling is rather squat and
unimpressive.  However, a large banner with the arms of the City hangs
before it.

The Golden Mile, Ravenspur~
The Golden Mile is a long boulevard which runs through the heart of the
City of Ravenspur.  Here, the avenue begins the ascent to the top of a
moderate hill, topped by some sort of archway which crosses the road.  To
the south, the Mile ends in a small plaza which opens onto a busily
trafficked bridge.  The street is here surrounded on either side by small
shops and a mixture of elegant apartment buildings and lush townhouses. 
Judging by the dress of the passersby and the look of the nearby carriages,
this is a wealthy part of town.

Plaza of Heroes, Ravenspur~
You stand in a large plaza of square paving-stones, bustling with
traffic.  The Plaza of Heroes was built in ages past as a place to
consecrate and immortalize great champions and defenders of the city, and so
two long rows of old, weathered statuary flank the sides of the Golden Mile
as it begins the ascent of the hill to the north.  Ravenspur's greatest
heroes look down upon an uneven spectacle of noblemen, boatsmen, and
adventurers; this plaza forms the intersection of three large avenues and is
one of the busines places in the City, with all manner of traffic from
various walks of life.  Directly to the south stands the great stone mass of
the Southquarter Bridge, spanning the broad, muddy Hocking.

Hocking Street, Ravenspur~
Hocking Street passes through a tidy, well-to-do neighborhood of
Ravenspur, bordered by small shops and a variety of brick and half-timbered
houses.  The townsfolk and passersby seem prosperous but humble, and the
streets are modestly busy with wagon and horseback traffic.  Hocking Street
runs east and west, entering a large square to the west.

Hocking Street at Epping, Ravenspur~
Hocking Street here intersects with Epping Street, forming a busy
intersection and a large square.  The surrounding houses and shops look
humble but prosperous, and a great deal of cart traffic passes through here
from the east.  The square is dominated by a large block of stone set
directly in the center, with a set of old wooden steps leading up to it. 
Atop the block is a basket, and beside it a chair in which usually sits
Ravenspur's most visible sign of law enforcement.  Hocking Street runs north
and south, and Epping Street runs east towards the city gate.

Antechamber at the Lyceum~
The entrance to the Lyceum leads rather unexpectedly onto a balcony.  A
large domed chamber is constructed of large white marble blocks, set closely
together.  Occasionally a porthole-like square of translucent stone admits a
dull light from somewhere beyond.  The most striking feature of this atrium
is its eastern edge, where the room - and visible space - end abruptly at a
balcony-style railing; beyond this is the starry void of empty space!  A
sheet of glass or crystal separates curious spectators from oblivion, but
the endless depths seem to suck all light from the room, returning only the
sparkle of starlight.  A pair of large silver doors leads outside to the
south, while another leads into the Lyceum proper to the north.  A few
wizards are here speaking quietly to one another, but visitors do not seem
eager to stay long.

Confusion~
The interior of the Lyceum seems an almost insubstantial, dreamlike kind
of place.  Entrances appear and disappear almost at will, as wizards
approach or depart them.  You are acutely aware of what seem like hundreds
of smaller classrooms and laboratories all around you; students and masters
file past in a leisurely manner, following familiar paths through the
labyrinthine Lyceum.  You seem to be pursuing one single path, but whether
you are passing along a corridor, down a flight of stairs, or cutting across
the corner of some larger room seems unclear as surroundings come and go
constantly.  It seems almost as if you are passing through a number of
places which all occupy the same space - but how to focus on one or another?
The path seems to take you north and south.  
 
A broad wooden door standing to the west is unusally stable;  it is painted
with the emblem of a white shield with a willow tree.
 
A free-standing door of frosted glass stands by itself to the east.  Into
the glass is etched the emblem of a bear encircled by a chain.

Solace~
In the very center of the Lyceum stands a small courtyard, open to the
outside.  It is always sunny here, except when it is not, and fleecy clouds
prevail in the skies, aside from those times when they don't.  The weather
here seems entirely under the control of the mages here; sometimes the
clouds grow dark or form odd, menacing shapes.  The courtyard itself
contains a small pond with a few ducks, and a little grove of olive trees
with a few crumbling stone benches.  It seems very quiet and peaceful here. 
Even the students of magic speak quietly amongst themselves and move slowly
and deliberately.  A small archway passes south back into the Lyceum proper.

Oiotim's Armours~
This large building seems less like a shop than a war museum.  Nearly all
of the available floor space is covered with wicker statues of warriors,
clad in a bewildering variety of armors from field plate to bronze scale,
hewing away at each other with, oddly, wooden weapons.  There are nearly two
dozen such freestanding models here, some of them partially disassembled as
pieces of armor are removed for sale.  Others are covered in chalk marks
indicating necessary alterations for various customers.  The open doorway
leads out to the south.

Swordsmens' Hall~
This long, rectangular hall seems almost to resound with a deep, ancient
tradition of martial glory.  The atmosphere is solemn and businesslike,
unusually so for a mercenaries' guildhall.  You stand in the central atrium
of the hall; above you several tiers of balconies surround the vault, rising
in four open stories of private meeting rooms and storage chambers.  To the
south, a huge wall is painted with an enormous mural, and a huge scarlet
banner, looking somewhat tattered and faded with age, hangs vertically from
the distant ceiling.  The sounds of combat and athletic training emerge
muffled from behind a pair of double doors leading south.  The well-guarded
main entrance is to the east.

banner~
The three-story-tall banner is apparently embroidered all along each side
in gold and silver thread.  In great black letters are emblazoned the words:
"SWORDSMENS HALL * CHARTERED YEAR OF THE TWELVE SERPENTS * DEDICATED TO THE
PURSUIT OF ARMS AND TO THE GLORY OF OUR FALLEN BROTHERS".  Underneath this
are sewn the arms of the Hall, a pair of interlocked arms bearing swords,
upon a black field.  
~
E
mural~
This enormous mural has apparently been painted over a long period of
time.  It is broken up into various panels; some depict famous battles in
which fought guild members, sometimes apparently on both sides, others are
long, solemnly inscribed lists of great champions or those who fell in the
defense of Ravenspur.  At the very top of the roll of champions, where the
paint is flaking away from extreme age, can be read the name "Thrax, fell in
defense of city."  Other great heroes such as Turan Taladin or Antechur the
Bald are listed in gilded letters.  You notice that the mural only extends
down to about twelve feet off the ground; apparently there is ample room for
future deeds and legends.

Sparring Hall~
This large room appears to be a gymnasium.  Dozens of men and women are
in here, wrestling, duelling, training at arms, and boxing.  The floors are
covered in thick mats, and long ropes for climbing hang from the distant
rafters, amidst brightly-colored banners listing the victors of years of
athletic contests.  About ten feet off the ground, a long balance beam is
wedged into a corner; two opponents battle each other with quarterstaves
while trying not to topple from the precarious span.  The room is filled
with battle cries and the grunts of exertation; occasionally there is a
pained shout as some competitor goes down.  A large pair of double doors
leads north out of the sparring hall.  To the south is a somewhat smaller
door, which appears to lead into an advanced training hall.

Hall of Remembrance~
This training room, much smaller than the great Sparring Hall, seems to
be devoted to the more precise arts.  To one side, three sparring partners
fence in a blinding fury of steel.  A mute giant of a man is in another
corner, training a city watchman in some form of unarmed combat.  The walls
of this room are covered in a bizaare array of military souvenirs; judging
by the collection, it appears that the most impressive trophies are removed
elsewhere as prizes of the City; here are kept the tattered banners and
dented helmets actually won in the course of desperate fighting.  This room,
it seems, is sanctified for the fighting men who actually bleed and die on
the field, and to their memory.  A small door leads back north to the
sparring hall.

Saltmaker Way, Ravenspur~
Saltmaker Way is a long, winding road which runs parallel to the
Greywater along most of its length.  It is bordered on one side by the murky
river, and on the other by a motley collection of small shops, musty old
cafes, ramshackle apartment houses, and odds and ends of old statuary. 
Here, the Way empties into the Plaza of Heroes to the east, and continues to
the west.

south, half-heartedly blocked by a rotten old City Watch barricade, is a
crumbling bridge of what must have once been fine white marble, now slowly
sinking into the river.  On the other side is the massive old ruin of Castle
Ravenspur, framed starkly against the sky in its decaying glory.

Old Arches, Ravenspur~
Old Arches is an old, timeworn relic of an era long past.  Spanning the
swirling Greywater in two great spans, still supported by a crumbling center
pile, it was built centuries ago to connect the city with Ravenspur Castle
on the south bank of the river.  The Arches (the bridge's original name has
long since been forgotten) was formerly lined with statues of great warriors
or generals of elder days; one by one these were stolen to adorn the great
villas of the city.  Ravenspur Castle itself rests to the south, its huge
iron gates rusted shut and its forlorn battlements abandoned by all save the
crows in these times.  To the north stands Saltmaker Way, and beneath you is
only the murky Greywater.

Outside a Decrepit Building~
You stand in the dark, grimy space under the awning of a run-down old
storefront.  This must have been a large enterprise at one point, but now
the display windows are cracked and the door is boarded up, or so it looks. 
Despite the appearance of desolation, a number of very discreet individuals
make their way silently here, although they seem quite adept at keeping in
the corner of your eye.  As you watch, someone opens the apparently
boarded-up front entrance and slips out.

The Ravenspur Society of Thieves~
Although seeming a run-down old ruin on the outside, on the inside this
guildhall might well be one of the most elegant buildings in Ravenspur.  A
fireplace burns merrily at one end of a room set with leather and mahogany
furniture.  Portraits of various old but canny-looking gentlemen are set
here and there upon the walls in tasteful rows; many younger but no less
ambitious-seeming persons lounge here and there on the couches and
armchairs, chatting discreetly with one another or reading various
manuscripts.  The room is laid out quite deceptively, with seemingly
unimportant alcoves opening up into large hallways and a number of doors
concealed behind plants or projecting bookcases.  One large door stands
prominently to the south, while the boarded-up entrance leads out to the
west.

shelf BOTANY, another SELENOGRAPHY, that one KATATHAUMATURGY, and so on.  A
long wooden counter runs along the back wall of the shop; behind this is a
set of cubbyholes apparently excavated in the walls.  Within these holes are
scrolls of various sorts; apparently these wares are not for the
uninitiated.  The atmosphere in here is musty, filled with the scent of
countless books of great age.  A wooden door, covered in floral carvings,

Choking yellow fumes obscure most of the interior of this run-down

counter and long leather straps which hang from the rafters, entwined with
various articles for sale.  Behind the counter, which upon further
inspection you realize is a plank upon two barrels, the foul-smelling fumes
obscure the remainder of the store which presumably contains some sort of
tanning operation.  The leather goods for sale here seem to be of excellent
quality, despite the dismal condition of this store.  Rats appear to make
great sport of running up and down the leather straps, rendering browsing
risky.  A broken old door leads out to the south.

Epping Street, Ravenspur~
Epping Street is a busy thoroughfare, running squarely through the middle
of a prosperous section of Ravenspur.  It is an unusually wide street, and
paved with cobblestones, probably to accommodate the heavy cart traffic
which passes through here as wagons laden with grain and fresh produce
rattle through on their way into town from the surrounding countryside.  
 
This street ends at a large square to the west, and passes down a slope to
the east towards a city gate.

Remains of the Epping Street Viaduct~
The Epping Street Viaduct was badly damaged in the recent explosions and
fire, and its broken remains now lean at a perilous angle, hanging over the
now-empty lots of rubble below and to the north.  The City Watch has placed
a barricade across both the east and west ends, as well as warning signs
advising travellers not to climb across the structure.  Spikes have been
placed in the ground to prevent foolhardy drovers from attempting to get
carts across the remaining bridge.

Epping Street, Ravenspur~
Epping Street is a broad, heavily travelled avenue leading through a busy
and prosperous district of Ravenspur.  It is surrounded in either side by
shops and outfitters, stables, travelers' inns, and boarding houses.  To the
east lies the great grey mass of the ancient city wall, interrupted by a
large gatehouse through which Epping Street passes out of the city.  The
street continues west into Ravenspur, passing down a slope to intersect
Whitemantle Lane to the west.  
 
A large inn with unusual glass panel windows stands along the northern side
of the street, its signboard bearing a picture of a hunting horn and the
accompanying pack of hounds.
 
To the south, an elegant stone building displays a sign bearing a large hammer.

The Cracked Tankard~
The Cracked Tankard seems a place for the sort of business deals not
conducted in public and the sort of deeds not discussed in public.  It is a
low, dingy, poorly lit sort of place; smoky oil lamps hang from the low,
sagging rafters, almost succeeding in concealing the mildew on the walls and
the rotten old plaster which falls silently in padded chunks to the floor. 
The clientele seems to consist of a particularly disreputable blend of
unemployed cutthroats, river pirates, discreet-looking fences in black
cloaks, and women of limited virtue.  A surly-looking bartender wipes a
grimy rag across the bar in a largely symbolic fashion, and a few waitresses
brave the circuit of broken tables.  The battered, splintering main door
leads out to the north.

The Riverwalk, Ravenspur~
The Riverwalk is a busy, bustling street built largely of planks and
extending partway out into the Hocking River.  The south side of the street
forms the river docks of the city, and the Walk is alive with boatsmen
tending to their craft, porters carrying crates and barrels into and out of
the various warehouses that predominate through here, and a variety of
persons of dubious character.  The buildings along the north side of the
street are mostly grey, weathered warehouses and ramshackle taverns.  The
Riverwalk continues east and west along the bank of the river.  
 
A small booth of rotten boards advertises 'Excursion Craft' from a peeling sign.

The Riverwalk, Ravenspur~
The Riverwalk here turns northeast, heading away from the river at a
slight tangent as a small rubbish-yard has compiled itself over the years
along the bank of the river.  This unofficial city dump is piled high with
old broken oars, rotten kegs, scraps of rag and rotten vegetables and grain;
it might be possible to pick your way over a few piles of junk and make your
way into it.  The north side of the street is crowded together with
battered, run-down looking warehouses; this does not seem the most seemly
district of town, and it seems that even sailors are reluctant to wander
down this way.  The Riverwalk continues west along the river, and dead-ends
east at a small, shadowy alley.

Bodkin's Bend~
Bodkin's Bend is a small, poorly-lit alley, lined on either side with
towering, rickety tenements.  Grey, sagging clotheslines cross the sky
overhead and persons who look as if they wish to remain incognito dart this
way and that on private errands in the shadows.  Women of ill repute infest
the doorways of long-closed taverns and shops; large muddy potholes and
refuse mark the streets.  Small groups of ruffians congregate on street
corners and lounge on crumbling fire escapes.  The Bend continues north. 
The end of the Riverwalk intersects to the west.  
 
Across the street to the south is an old run-down tavern;  a large cracked
pottery tankard is its only signboard.

very subtle structure on the east side of the street; an old abandoned
storefront looks unremarkable save that it is guarded by two very silent
gentlemen dressed in fine black clothes.  The Bend continues south.  
 
An old building to the north is a recently-burnt-out ruin.

Hocking Street, Ravenspur~
Hocking Street here is a rather narrow lane of uneven bricks which passes
down the side of a hill, connecting the heart of Ravenspur with its poor
riverfront district.  Ramshackle houses and old wooden tenements cling to
the hillside, crisscrossed by old laundry lines and surrounded by street
peddlers.  The narrow street rattles with the sounds of carts and wagons
straining up the hill from the riverfront.  
 
On the eastern side of the street is a new brick building,
painted with 'HOCKING LIATH CO.'  On the western side of the street
stands a shopfront, its shutters recently nailed shut.  The door however
is not barred, and the building's sign has been painted over.
 
A manhole is set into the ground in the middle of the street.

Dagnar's Folly~
The "folly" is one of the strangest structures in Ravenspur.  A small
ravine cuts into the side of the hill here, forming a large depression. 
Decades ago, the then-Lord Mayor Dagnar constructed a large wooden platform
which juts out above this gap, accessible by a long, winding staircase to
the east.  It is not clear to what purpose the Mayor built this edifice,
whether military or otherwise, but Dagnar's Folly now affords one of the
best views of Ravenspur anywhere.  The docks unfold below you and to the
south, and from here you can see the Hocking River and the forests beyond. 
The rest of the city is actually above you on the hillside to the north and
east, but you are elevated high enough to catch glimpses of the quiet
boardwalks and tiny shacks which form the discreet Overcity.  On clear
summer nights, the astronomers come here to peer at the stars; on cloudy
nights lovers venture here for furtive trysts.

Mortar and Pestle~
This strange little place actually seems smaller on the inside than on
the outside.  Rows of crude and rickety-looking cane shelves are everywhere,
standing at odd, crooked angles all over the place.  A stunning variety of
glass, crystal, and ceramic containers perch upon these shelves, filled with
ointments, fluids, and animals, both live and dead.  In each of the corners
of the room stands a huge glass jar, filled with a bubbling colored fluid. 
The ceilings are quite low in here, giving the impression of being in
somebody's basement.  The occasional cloud of fumes wafts by, making the
quality of air quite dubious.  A swinging door, quite padlocked, apparently
leads into the back room, and a large, chemical-stained notice commands much
attention.  A surprisingly well reinforced door leads back out.

Whitemantle Lane is a wide street of packed earth, winding east and north
into a broad ravine which juts into the hillside.  The Lane district is
heavily populated, and houses of a goodly size line the street on either
side, most in good repair and recently painted.  A few stubborn trees grow
on the hillside, giving this little valley a shady appearance.  The Lane
twists east through the ravine, and leads up to the west to intersect with
Hocking Street.

Vacant Crossroads~
Teams of men have dug, hacked, and chipped at the sides of the ravine,
carving out a passage and dumping tons of earth to make a sloped embankment.
Where once stood the Epping Street Viaduct, the road has been smoothed and
sloped so that Whitemantle Lane and Epping Street join at a new crossroads. 
The streets themselves are almost obliterated beneath the loose dirt and
gravel of construction, but men are laboriously sweeping and smoothing the
streets to make them suitable for passage once more.  
 
Epping Street leads east and west, and Whitemantle Lane passes north into
a large marketplace, continuing south through a small ravine.

Construction Site, Ravenspur~
The road disappears into an open expanse.  All the surrounding buildings
have been pulled down, leaving a great open clearing in the middle of
Ravenspur.  Teams of men are hauling away flame-scorched rubble from the
demolition, and gangs with shovels and pickaxes are clearing out and filling
in old cellars and smoothing the shattered, pockmarked ground.  The air is
filled with the shouts of work crews, the bray of the mules hauling the
rubble wagons, and the periodic crash of old masonry being torn apart.  
 
To the south opens a narrow ravine in a hillside, with a residential lane
running along its length.  The open construction site continues to the north.
 
One lone shop stands to the west, apparently having survived the disaster.

Whitemantle and Blackmantle~
Whitemantle Lane is a wide street of packed earth which passes through a
prosperous district.  Small houses and shops abound; large numbers of
students congregate here in the area taverns and pubs, which seem to cater
to a quieter and more affluent clientele.  Amongst all these are a number of
crumbling old mansions, converted into apartments for students or young
noblemen.  
 
Whitemantle Lane continues east and west, passing into the new Whitemantle
Market to the east.  A small, narrow, shabby-looking street winds through
an old brick archway to the north, winding towards a city gate.

Whitemantle Lane before the Lyceum~
This section of Whitemantle Lane is dominated by an imposing structure of
white marble which occupies the north side of the street for a good
distance.  The Lyceum of Ravenspur is one of the largest mages' academies in
Balfeymere; its twin stone griffons guard the structure's main entrance in a
perhaps more than figurative fashion.  The Lane here forms the students'
quarter, and this is reflected in that most of the surrounding houses have
been converted into apartments or offices.  Students mill about here and
there, chatting with one another or conjuring a few discreet illusions of
interest.  The Lane continues east and west.  
 
On the south side of the street stands an old, dusty-looking bookshop.

lyceum~
The Lyceum is large and squarish, about thirty feet tall.  Its marble
blocks are joined seamlessly, but without benefit of mortar; it is said that
when the Lyceum falls the City itself will follow close behind.  Its facade
is supported by six great fluted columns, and twin griffon statues flank a
great staircase which leads up to a pair of silver-bound doors carved with
massive runes.  The architectural perfection of the building is marred only
by a curious addition: an old, rusted iron hook which projects from one of
the supporting columns.  This strange imperfection must serve some purpose,
for the masters of the Lyceum have never seen fit to remove it.

see an old manor or tenement being repaired or receiving a fresh coat of
paint.  Large numbers of student congregate here and there; taverns and pubs
in the area seem to cater to a quieter and more affluent clientele, and a
few of the buildings along this street sport subdued plaques indicating that
they are the offices of one wizards' society or another.  The Lane continues
east, running past an impressive marble hall, and intersects with the Golden
Mile to the west.

Ravenspur Dumping Ground~
The Dumping Ground is Ravenspur's unofficial city dump.  Once a pleasant
if abandoned lot along the northern bank of the Hocking, this place has
suffered the unfortunate indignity of being a convenient place for passing
boats to dump rubbish.  The Dumping Ground is piled high with old, rotten
cargoes of grain and fruit, broken barrels, discarded fishing nets, and all
manner of rags and animal bones.  A thick layer of weeds and mosses grows
over all, adding to the miasma and making walking through this place
difficult.  The Riverwalk passes by to the north, and to the south is only
the Hocking River.  
 
A narrow crevice in the ground looks too small to squeeze through, but you
can see the grey stonework of forgotten tombs below.

in large hedges.  
 
An elegantly lettered notice hangs upon a post.  It reads,  'Tours of the
